<p><em>The only truly assertive female in the Grimmsâ€™ tale is the bitter, evil, neglected <a href="./ffgmD.html">thirteenth fairy</a>. Almost ridiculously, the Grimms portray the wicked fairy as rude. By linking neglect with a transgression of <a href="./page9.html">gender roles</a> and social norms, the Grimms warn their female audience against breaking from <a href="./page11.html">acceptable roles in society.</a></em></p>
